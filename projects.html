                <div class="bakery">
                    The Bakery Management System is a project I developed using Java and JavaFX. This application streamlines bakery operations by managing inventory, sales, and customer orders efficiently. The intuitive user interface built with JavaFX allows for easy navigation and interaction, ensuring that bakery staff can quickly input and access critical data. Key features include product management, order tracking, and sales reporting, all designed to enhance productivity and accuracy in daily bakery operations.

                    The "Student Management System" is a console-based application developed in C language. This project allows administrators to manage student records efficiently. Key features include adding, modifying, deleting, and viewing student details such as names, roll numbers, and grades. The application uses file handling to store and retrieve data, ensuring persistence across sessions. This project demonstrates proficiency in C programming, including data structures, file operations, and user interface design in a text-based environment.

                <div class="employee">
                    For my Employee Payroll project, developed in C language, I created a system that manages employee data, calculates salaries, and generates pay slips. The project features functionalities such as adding new employees, updating existing records, and computing salaries based on various parameters like working hours and deductions. It also includes basic error handling and data validation to ensure the accuracy and reliability of payroll information. This project allowed me to apply my C programming skills to solve real-world problems and enhance my understanding of file handling and data structures.
